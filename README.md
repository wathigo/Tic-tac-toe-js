Based on the [ Tic tac toe Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript) in the odin project as a part of the Microverse curriculum. The purpose was to have a second contact with Javascript making use of Factory Functions and the Module Pattern.

The project is able to request two names for the players and display a gameboard in which we will be able to play Tic tac toe.

  1) Two players will take turns to mark the spaces on a 3x3 grid. (Clicking with the cursor)
  
  2) The player who succeeds in placing 3 of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. 
  
  3) When there are no more spaces left to mark, it is consider a draw. 
  
  4) To place a mark on the grid, type the number on the space you would like to mark! 
     Good luck!
